My name is Aidar Assylbekov. I have a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Eastern Mediterranean University. I remember going into the university I was most excited about learning computer networks and even saw myself becoming a network engineer once I graduate. However, when I took my first ever programming course my interests started to shift. Without having any prior programming experience whatsoever initially it was quite challenging to grasp some of the concepts. However, the professor's brilliant teaching techniques have challenged and inspired me to learn how to code. My interest in coding continued to grow stronger with every subsequent programming course that I took. \nDuring the summer break, I have interned at a software development company where I was able to put acquired knowledge to use and continued to learn new techniques from senior developers. After graduation, I have worked as a front-end engineer with technologies such as Vue and Angular. \nMy current goal is to become a full-stack engineer which is why I have decided to pursue a master's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I believe that studying core computer science fundamentals such as algorithms, software, and database design at a masterâ€™s level will help me lay a solid foundation for reaching my goal.\n"}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
